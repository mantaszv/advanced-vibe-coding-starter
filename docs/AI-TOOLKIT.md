## 1. MCP Servers (Model Context Protocol)

### Available MCP Servers

Use whichever MCP servers are configured in your project. Common ones:

| MCP Server              | Purpose               | Key Tools                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supabase**            | Database operations   | `list_tables`, `execute_sql`, `apply_migration`, `generate_typescript_types`, `get_advisors` |

## 2. Project Agents (Guards)

These agents serve as **guardrails** — run them PRE/POST implementation:

| Guard                    | Model  | PRE/POST  | When to Use                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **payment-guardian**     | Sonnet | PRE       | Before changes to payment/checkout/webhook code      |
| **db-guardian**          | Sonnet | PRE/POST  | Before/after DB migrations and schema changes        |
| **lang-reviewer**        | Haiku  | POST      | After modifying components with user-facing text     |
| **pre-deploy**           | Haiku  | POST (bg) | Before commit/deploy — lint, tests, build            |
| **file-splitter**        | Sonnet | PRE       | Before splitting files over {{MAX_FILE_LINES}} lines |
| **risk-assessor**        | —      | PRE       | During PRD/task generation for critical paths        |
| **dependency-guardian**  | Haiku  | PRE       | Before deploy — vulnerability audit, outdated deps   |
| **test-quality-guardian**| Sonnet | POST      | After writing tests — meaningfulness, coverage gaps  |

## 5. Orchestration Pattern

Every task in a task list follows this structure:

```markdown
- [ ] **{NUMBER} {TITLE}** [BLOCKS: {OTHER}]
  - **Orchestration**:
    - _MCP_:
      - {server} (`{tool}` — {purpose})
    - _Agents_:
      - `{agent}` ({what it does})
    - _Guards_:
      - `{guard}` ({PRE/POST} — {purpose})
    - _Skills_:
      - `{skill-name}`
    - _Verify_:
      - `{command}` — {what it checks}
  - [ ] {NUMBER}.1 {What to change} (`{file}` lines {X-Y})
  - [ ] {NUMBER}.2 {Related change} (`{file}`)
  - [ ] {NUMBER}.3 Write tests: {what they verify}
```

## 6. Tool Selection Matrix

| Task Type    | MCP                  | Agent                                | Guard                           | Skill                  |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| DB schema    | Database             | backend-architect                    | db-guardian                     | —                      |
| API endpoint | Database, Context7   | backend-architect, security-engineer | —                               | `/sc:implement`        |
| UI component | Context7, Playwright | frontend-architect                   | lang-reviewer                   | `frontend-design`      |
| Payment code | Payments             | —                                    | payment-guardian, risk-assessor | —                      |
| Bug fix      | Sequential-thinking  | root-cause-analyst                   | —                               | `systematic-debugging` |
| Refactoring  | —                    | refactoring-expert                   | file-splitter                   | `simplify`             |

| Performance  | —                    | performance-engineer                 | —                               | `/sc:analyze`          |

## 7. Verification Pipeline

Standard verification before commit:

```
1. npm run lint         → 0 errors, 0 warnings
2. npm run test:run         → All tests pass ({{COVERAGE_THRESHOLD}}%+)
3. npm run build        → No compilation errors
4. lang-reviewer agent  → UI text in correct language
5. pre-deploy agent     → Full pre-deploy validation
```

## 8. Development Workflow Commands

| Command                | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/create-prd`          | Generate PRD with risk assessment + orchestration hints |
| `/generate-tasks`      | Generate task list from PRD with orchestration blocks   |
| `/process-tasks`       | Process one sub-task at a time with guard execution     |
| `/process-tasks-batch` | Batch mode — complete main tasks with PRE/POST guards   |
| `/status`              | View current task progress and next action              |

---

## 9. Hooks (Automatic Guards)

CWK installs hooks that run automatically without manual invocation:

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| File size check | `PreToolUse(Write\|Edit)` | Warns if file exceeds {{MAX_FILE_LINES}} lines, suggests file-splitter |
| Pre-deploy reminder | `Stop` | Reminds to run build/test/lint before ending session |

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` under the `hooks` key.

## 10. Examples

See the `examples/` directory in the CWK repository for complete samples:

- `examples/prd-example.md` — Full PRD with risk assessment and orchestration hints
- `examples/tasks-example.md` — Complete task list with orchestration blocks and execution strategy
